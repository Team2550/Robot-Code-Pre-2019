# Before You Do Anything
Before you checkout code, you should first extract the eclipse workspace from
either the workspace\.zip or workspace\.tar\.gz archive \(they're identical\)
into the current directory; if you've done it right, you should see
* \.git
* \.metadata
* Project
* RemoteSystemsTempFiles
* README\.md
* workspace\.tar\.gz
* workspace\.zip

Once that's done, you're ready to checkout one of the branches with code \(for
example, Testbed\-Master\)\.

# Commit Format
<p> When making a commit, you must follow the following format:</p>
<ul>

# Repo Structure:
<p>Our repository is made up of a branching system.</p>
<br>
<p>Every branch with the word "Master" in the title is made up of code that is guaranteed to work 100% of the time.</p>
<p>All unstable or development code is located in branches off the "Master" branches.</p>
