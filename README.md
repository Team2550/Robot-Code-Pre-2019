# Before You Do Anything
Before you checkout code, you should first extract the eclipse workspace from
either the workspace\.zip or workspace\.tar\.gz archive \(they're identical\)
into the current directory; if you've done it right, you should see
* \.git
* \.metadata
* Project
* RemoteSystemsTempFiles
* README\.md
* workspace\.tar\.gz
* workspace\.zip

Once that's done, you're ready to checkout one of the branches with code \(for
example, Testbed\-Master\)\.
